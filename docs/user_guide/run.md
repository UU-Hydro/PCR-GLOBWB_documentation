# How to run

If you have installed the Python package environment, acquired the PCR-GLOBWB model code and setup a working configuration file you can now run the PCR-GLOBWB model. Go to to the PCR-GLOBWB model directory and start a PCR-GLOBWB run using the following commands:


```bash
conda activate pcrglobwb_python3
python deterministic_runner.py <ini_configuration_file>
```

where <ini_configuration_file\> is the configuration file of PCR-GLOBWB. This will activate the pcrglobwb_python3 environment and run the model with your configuration file.
