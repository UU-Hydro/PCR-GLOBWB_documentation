# Tutorials

Below are four tutorials developed for courses at the [Department of Physical Geography, Utrecht University (Netherlands)](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/faculty-of-geosciences). Although these tutorials may be a bit older, they give valuable insight and understanding on how to work with the PCR-GLOBWB model. Each tutorial comes as a downloadable file.
