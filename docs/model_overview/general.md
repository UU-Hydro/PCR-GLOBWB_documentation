# PCR-GLOBWB model overview

PCR-GLOBWB is a grid-based hydrology and water resources model, implemented in Python using open-source PCRaster Python framework. Up to now, the stable version comes in two versions: one with a spatial resolution of 5 arcmin and another with a coarser 30 arcmin resolution. Typical time steps for hydrology and water use are daily. It uses a time-explicit scheme for simulating moisture storage in soil layers and water exchange among soil, atmosphere, and groundwater. Human water use is integrated, estimating water demands and withdrawals for various sectors at each time step. The model routes runoff generated by various sources across the river, as well lake and reservoir modules. 

PCR-GLOBWB aims to a flexible modular structure, allowing modification or replacement of components and coupling with existing codes. The main hydrological modules include meteorological forcing, land surface, groundwater, and surface water routing. For detailed descriptions of the modules and coupling to MOFLOW, refer to the respective sections.
